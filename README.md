# RunSettings
Item templates for runsettings files

A set of Runsettings solution templates for VS2017 and upwards.   
The runsettings contains separate sections for the adapters.  The settings for the [NUnit Adapter is described here](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Tips-And-Tricks). 

Right click the solution, choose Add/New Item and choose one of the Runsettings under General, and the runsettings file is added as a solution item, and opened as XML in your editor.
